# Hisense/Hitachi H-NET-Protocol

## Ready-to-use hardware units

This repository documents my reverse engineering work on the Hisense/Hitachi H-Net protocol.
Based on that work, I have also built a small batch of ready-to-use HBS Bridge hardware units for integrating Hisense Hi-Therma and Hitachi Air H₂O 400 heat pumps with Home Assistant via MQTT autodiscovery.
More details are available here:

# Project description 
This project aims to reverse engineer the H-NET protocol used in the Hi-Therma/Air H₂O 400 unit lineup, allowing direct control of the machines without depending on the proprietary cloud platform. A custom Home Assistant component will be developed too.

## System description

Hisense Hi-Therma lineup is composed of both monobloc and split heatpumps. The unit I have under test is a 8kW monobloc type AHZ-080HCDS1.

## Communication interfaces

There are 2 HBS interfaces present on the indoor unit; one is used for the communication with the master controller ( HSXM-FE01 ) while the other one is used for the communication between outdoor/indoor unit (in my case they are both outdoor) and remote control with the auxilliary Hi-mit II remote controller (HCCS-H64H2C1M). Both can be found at CN1 of PCB1 and they are routed differently between the monobloc/split units. Pin 3,4 are the ones used for the master controller and are labeled as A,B on the terminal block TB4 present on PCB4. Pin 1,2 of CN1 are reserved for the communication with indoor unit / remote interface and are available on TB4 in split units. These pin on the monobloc unit are wired to PCB6 and are also available on the terminal block on PCB7.
